        for taking notes and organizing them
        in a non-linear structure.

      Why use nodebook?

        Associative approach helps you to recall
        things faster, as long as you remember
        how things are connected with each other.
        Human's memory is associative, so let your
        notes be organized in an easy memorable
        way.
  %h2 Concepts
  %h3 Node
  %p
    Think of it as a single note, though it is
    not necessarily a full and multisectioned
    article. It could be index, section or even
    a single definition as well.
  %p
    Nodes have levels. Level is a value of node
    given by you. It's meant to organize nodes
    hierarchically, i.e. topic index should have
    greater value than articles, section or
    definitions it refers to.
  %p
    Greater level also force node to be bigger
    and arranged highter on a <a href="#map">map</a>.
  %p
    Nodes also have title that shown on a map
    to identify a node and content, which is
    text written basically in <a href="#mde">extended
    markdown</a>.
  %h3#map Map
  %p
    Map is a graphical representation of your
    nodebook: all the nodes are shown here
    according to their levels from top to
    bottom. If one node <a href="#ref">referred</a> to
    another there is an edge(arrow), pointing from
    the referring node to the referred one.

  %h3#ref Reference
  %p
    One node (let's call it A) could have link to
    another (B). These links could be explicit,
    represented just as link definitions at the
    bottom of node's content.
  %p
    For A to have edge to B there must be a link
    definition in the content of A.
  %p
    Just use that definition somewhere in A's
    content to refer to B.

  %h2 Composing nodes
  %p
    When you click 'Add node' button above the map or
    click 'Add child' or 'Edit' in a node's menu inside
    a map, you will find yourself on a nodes edit page.
  %p
    Here you can (re)name node, (re)assign level and edit
    node's content.
  %h3 Editor
  %p
    Editor is two-sided. One is a text-editor and the other
    is a rendered result, what you will see as node's content
    when you are done.
  %p#mde
    Language of the source text in that text-editor side is
    <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/markdown">markdown</a>.
    There are also some extensions to typeset mathematical formulas
    using latex.
  %p
    To type inline math formulae, surround it with dollar signs($).
    For block math, use double dollar signs. Also see <a href="#examples">
    examples</a>.
